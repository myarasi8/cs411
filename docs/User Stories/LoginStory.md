## **Log In / Security  Stories:**

-As a user, I navigate to the app’s webpage to utilize the recommendation services of the application. 

The user will navigate to the app's webpage where they will find the title of the app, a description of what the app does, and an option to register for the app or log into the app through Twitter. There will be a login button that allows the user to sign in with Twitter. Conversely there will be a sign out button on the user’s profile that brings them back to the login page.


-As a new user, I want to log into the app using my Twitter account, so that I may enjoy the apps features. 

Once the user clicks the ‘log in through Twitter’ button they will be redirected to the Twitter login page and after the user has successfully logged in / registered through Twitter, they will be redirected to the app’s web page which will display a personalized message: 
"Welcome to <APP NAME>, <USER'S NAME>." 

This will signal to the user, that they have successfully logged into the app. Allowing them to continue using the apps features or allowing them to access the Service Set Up menu where they may input their subscription information (refer to ‘Service Set Up Stories’). 


-As a user, I want to log out of my profile when I’m done, so that others may not access it.

When the user wants to log out of their profile, the app will display a goodbye message:
"Don't forget the snacks and drinks for your movie! Hope we can help you again soon." 
With this goodbye message, the user knows that their profile is not accessible by others.

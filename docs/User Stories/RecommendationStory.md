## **Recommendation Stories:**


-As a user, I request a recommendation on what show to watch, so that I can skip the arduous process of looking for something myself, and am presented with shows or movies tailored to my mood.

Once the user is logged in and has completed set up (refer to ‘Service Set Up’ Stories), they will see a button near the middle of the page, the button reads "RECOMMEND". 

-As a user, I click the ‘RECOMMEND’ button so that I may see my recommended TV shows. 

Once the user clicks ‘RECOMMEND’ the recommendation tab will display a TV Shows and a Movies that reflect the user’s mood. If the user hasn’t set up their subscriptions properly refer to ‘Service Set Up’ Stories, an error message will appear alerting them to clarify their streaming service(s). A problem that could occur is that the user has already seen these recommendations. In this case, we recommend the user just refresh their page and ask for new recommendations. __A way of keeping track of watched movies will be added later.__ 


## **Future Directions**


-If the recommendations have already been watched by the user, they can decide to request new recommendations. 

So, there will be a button that says “I’ve already seen this” that will delete the recommendation and bring up the next most relevant recommendation on the list.

-As a user, I want to share the app’s recommendation to impress / intrigue my colleagues.   

When the user clicks on their decision, the site will give them an option to share their results. It will redirect them to Twitter where they can post about their result (including both their recommendation and mood).

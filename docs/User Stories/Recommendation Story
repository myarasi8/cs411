Recommendation Stories:

-As a user, I request a recommendation on what show to watch, so that I can skip the arduous process of looking for something myself, and am presented with shows tailored to my mood.
Once the user is logged in and has completed set up (refer to ‘Service Set Up’ Stories), they will navigate to the Recommendations tab where they will see their name displayed- this way, again, the user knows that they are logged in. In this tab they will see a button near the middle of the page, the button reads "RECOMMEND". 

-As a user, I click the ‘RECOMMEND’ button so that I may see my recommended TV shows. 
Once the user clicks ‘RECOMMEND’ the recommendation tab will display the top 5 TV Shows/Movies that reflect the user’s mood. If the user hasn’t set up their subscriptions properly refer to ‘Service Set Up’ Stories, an error message will appear alerting them to clarify their streaming service(s). A problem that could occur is that the user has already seen these recommendations. So, there will be a button that says “I’ve already seen this” that will delete the recommendation and bring up the next most relevant recommendation on the list.

-As a user, I want to share the app’s recommendation to impress / intrigue my colleagues.   
When the user clicks on their decision, the site will give them an option to share their results. It will redirect them to Twitter where they can post about their result (including both their recommendation and mood).

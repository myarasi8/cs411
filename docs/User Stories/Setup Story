Service Set Up Stories:

The user inputs which streaming sites they are subscribed to. There would be a list of popular streaming sites: Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO GO and they click on the ones they have accounts for. Then they click choose and a list of TV shows and Movies appear.

-As a user, to utilize the app properly, I will inform it on what streaming sites I am subscribed to so that it only recommends shows from those sites. 
When the user navigates to the Service Set Up tab, they will see displayed in a 2X2 grid all of the streaming sites that the app interacts with. The user will select the ones that they are subscribed to by clicking on them, the cell of the apps that the user clicks on appears in a darker color now. When the user sees the darker background on the grid, the user knows that the app is taking that streaming site into account when it is going to recommend me something to watch. If the user made a mistake and clicked on a service that they are not subscribed to, the user can click on it again and when the cell turns back to the original lighter color, the user knows that the app will not take this service into account and the mistake was corrected. 
The web page will also display a list of all of the streaming services that user has selected so far at all times. This way the user can double check that they've selected appropriately before they click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page and finish the setup process. 
The user always has the option to navigate to the Set Up tab and change their streaming services so that they reflect their current subscriptions at all times.

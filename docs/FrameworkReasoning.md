## **Framework Decision**


When deciding on what kind of framework we wanted to use we looked at Express.js, ASP.NET, Django, and Flask. A couple members had been introduced to Javascript and C# however the entire group was familiar with Python so it made sense to use Django or Flask. Now when deciding between these two frameworks, we chose Flask because overall it has a smaller framework. This makes it easier for all members of the group to ensure we have the same packages and versions running. Additionally, Flask offers better noSQL support without using extensions and since we are still in the early prototyping phase it is important to have flexibility in regards what kind of database our back-end we decide on.

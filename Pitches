Idea 1: 

With the amount of streaming sites available to the consumers and the vast libraries of shows and movies to choose from, 
it is very difficult to decide what to watch.  This app will give the user a suggestion for a show or movie, based on what 
streaming sites they subscribe to and their current moods.  This app will gather recent tweets from a user, send them through 
IBM Watson Tone Analyzer to get the personâ€™s mood, and select the best choice via genre and ratings using the IMDB API.  
JustWatch API will be used to gather the current libraries on each of the streaming sites.

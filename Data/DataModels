This folder holds an ERD diagram representing our current SQL database. 
Additionally it holds a sequence diagram showing the flow of work from when a user asks for a 
recommendation to the multiple api calls and caching step that is done until
they receive their relevant recommendations.

Our planned cache implementation:
After analyzing a user's latest tweets through the IBM Watson API, the app will pair the returned mood
to an appropriate genre. Our cache implementation occurs here, before calling the 'JustWatch' API to find movies
relevant to that genre our app will check the data within the SQL database to see if movies relevant to that genre 
have already been stored. 
  If so, these relevant movies are retrieved from the database and returned to the user as a recommendation.
  If not, the app will call the 'JustWatch' API to find the movies relevant to the given genre / mood store 
    this data in the database, and return the movies to the user as a recommendation.
(Refer to ERD diagram and Sequence diagram for further clarity).
